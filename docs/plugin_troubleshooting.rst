Plugin Troubleshooting
======================

If you install a plugin but don't see it listed as a valid
option, you can try running the :program:`./plugin_test.py` script from the
main project folder.  This script is a simple diagnostic that lists all 
available plugins of the types relevant to txcas.  Pay special attention to
any error output produced, as it may indicate some kind of problem with the
plugin installation.
